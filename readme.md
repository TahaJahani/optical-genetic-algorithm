# Optical Genetic Algorithm

## File descriptions

### Components.ipynb
This file contains classes of some useful components that are used in simulation.

### Sample Table.ipynb
This file contains a sample optical setup to test the performance of PyOpTools library.

### Setting.ipynb
This file contains inforamtion and config parameters of the genetic algorithm. You can change the values based on the needs of you output.

### Solution.ipynb
This file contains two parts:
- The first part is the main class of each __Item__ in the genetic algorithm.
- The second part shows a sample program that run the genetic algorithm to find the best config of a priscope.
